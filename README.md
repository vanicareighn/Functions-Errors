# Functions-Errors
ETH Intermediate Module 1: Functions and Errors- this smart contract program demonstrating the assert and revert functions and also the require statements.

## Description


The Smart Contract is made to handle a single value on Ethereum. It allows only the owner to change this value, ensuring security. The code demonstrates good error handling practices using different statements to protect data and avoid mistakes. This also handles one value securely, allowing only the owner to change it. By using require, assert, and revert statements to ensure it's reliabilty and without an error handling. This contract provides useful lessons in building safe and reliable smart contracts for decentralized transactions.
